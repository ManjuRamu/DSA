Internal hashing

 1. Dvivison
 2. Folding
 3. Mid square 

Dvivison: 
    let's say we have to has some elements = [1,34,5,66,78,28,18,28]
    Sol: 
     take fixed size of array 10.
     take mod of each elements and store it in respective index.
     index
     0 
     1 - 1
     2
     3
     4 -34
     5 -5
     6 -66
     7
     8 -18->28->28->78
     9
     10
    in this above we have 18,28,7 has same mode, so store them in sorted list;
    18->28->28->78 called linear chaing

    collisions: 
    if an input array has same mode result 
    every this goes in same index and so it take O(n)to read called 'collision'
